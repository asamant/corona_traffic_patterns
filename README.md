# Visual effect of COVID-19 on city traffic

This code takes screenshots of maps of cities notorious for road traffic - it compares the usual traffic patterns and those seen during the COVID-19 outbreak. Lockdowns imposed by several countries have led to people staying indoors and not venturing out leading to a massive drop in traffic on the road. This is seen in the form of "green" lines on cities when seen through Google Maps.
